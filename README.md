# Personal Website

## Platform

Personal website. Originally built using Preact with no build tools, jsx, etc.

I recently introduced Vite into the build process. I was **very** hesitant to do this, but wanted to try it as an experiment with HMR, and for potentially using TypeScript in the future. Easy enough to roll back if I decide I don't like it.


## Future Plans

I'd like to use this site as a platform to do a couple things:

1. Mess around with TypeScript.
2. Build a PWA.
